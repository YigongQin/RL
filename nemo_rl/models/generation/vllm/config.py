class StreamingToolCallConfig(TypedDict):
    """Configuration for resumable prefill during a running tool call.

    Attributes:
        enabled: Whether streaming tool-call prefill endpoints are enabled.
            The recommended default is false until the full environment path is
            configured.
        max_sessions: Maximum number of concurrent prefill sessions per vLLM
            replica. The recommended default is 256.
        session_ttl_seconds: Idle lifetime of a prefill session before cleanup.
            The recommended default is 900 seconds.
        stability_margin_tokens: Number of tokens held behind the proven common
            prefix to protect tokenizer boundary changes. The recommended
            default is 8.
        min_chunk_chars: Minimum new shell-output characters before requesting
            another tokenization. The recommended default is 256.
        snapshot_poll_interval_seconds: Interval between runtime reads of the
            current shell-output snapshot. This should not be lower than the
            producer's snapshot cadence. The recommended default is 0.1
            seconds; use 0.05 seconds to match OpenHands' current producer
            cadence when measuring admission coverage.
        flush_interval_seconds: Maximum interval between eligible partial-output
            tokenizations. The recommended default is 0.25 seconds.
        request_timeout_seconds: Maximum duration of one streaming prefill HTTP
            request before the action falls back to normal execution. The
            recommended default is 60 seconds.
